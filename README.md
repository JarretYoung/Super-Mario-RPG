# Super-Mario-RPG

This game is a Super Mario Themed turn-based game. You play as "Mario" who roams the map and traverses multiple worlds/levels in order to save the "Princess" from "Bowser". During his journey "Mario" can collect items, currency and weapons to help him in his journey. 

This project came with a basecode accompanied by a simple engine; a small team was lead to implement new features to the base game such as: new skills, items, enemies, actions, weapons and new (overall) features. This project demonstrates an strong considerations and adherace (where applicable) to SOLID Object Oriented Principles to ensure a neat and robust class hierarchy. Thourough (to the best of our abilities) considerations were made via planning including the usage UML diagrams and rationales to help build a clear class structure and dependencies.
